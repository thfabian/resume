\textbf{Compiler Framework for Domain Specific Languages in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Models}

\textbf{\textit{Master Thesis}}, supervised Prof.\ Dr.\ T.\ Hoefler and Dr.\ C.\ E.\ Osuna

\begin{itemize}
	\item Created a novel domain-specific language for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics models by extending C++ using the LLVM/Clang compiler infrastructure
	\item Developed a new compiler framework for DSLs including GPU based optimization techniques, code generation and static analysis
	\item Assessed the performance of the new language using the Piz Daint petascale supercomputer at the CSCS
\end{itemize}
